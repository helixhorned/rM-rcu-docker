# These udev rules match:
#
#  Vendor: Freescale Semiconductor Inc
#  Product: SE Blank MEGREZ
#   "i.MX 6Solo/6DualLite SystemOnChip in RecoveryMode", according to
#   https://devicehunt.com/view/type/usb/vendor/15A2/device/0061
#
# and make sure that the device node that is created as the tablet enters recovery mode
# (which should reside under /dev/bus/usb/) can be read and written by the non-root user
# setting up this rule. The setup of rM-rcu-docker's Docker image is such that this user
# will have the same UID and GID as on the host system, which is one part of exposing this
# access permission to a running container.
